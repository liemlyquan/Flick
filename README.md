# FLICK

A quick program to show now playing and top rated movie based on the database from [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/)

Time spent (in detailed and sequence):
- 0.5 (mostly waiting for Pod installation)
- 2.5 (most of basic, except for detailed view and controller)
- 0.5 (add a truly basic details view, with just an image view)
- 3.5 (add scrollview into details, improve network checking, and fixing some issues on the way)
- 0.5 (add basic search bar, works, not tested with different interaction yet)
